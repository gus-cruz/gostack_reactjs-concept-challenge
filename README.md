  Challenge 03: ReactJS concepts
</h3>

## :rocket: About

In this challenge, I created an application to train and improve what I've studied so far at ReactJS!

This application was developed to store the portfolio repositories, in which I had already created a back-end in my last [challenge using Node.js](https://github.com/gustavofrc/gostack_desafio-conceito-node).

### Features

- **`List API repositories`**: Able to create a list with the **title** of all repositories that are registered in the API.

- **`Add repository in the API`**: Able to add a new item in the API via a button with the text **Adicionar** and after that it is able to display its name.

- **`Remove API repository`**: Each item in the list has a button with the text **Remover** that, when clicked, will call a function that will remove that item from the API.

### Challenge test specifications

- **`should be able to add new repository`**: In order for this test to pass, your application must allow a repository to be added to your backend and listed on your frontend within a `LI`.

- **`should be able to remove repository`**: In order for this test to pass, your application must allow the item to be removed from the list by clicking on the remove button that will be inside the `LI` of the added repository.
